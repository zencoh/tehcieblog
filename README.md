## Description
This project is a tech blog where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. Then this project has been deployed to heroku. By using mysql database to store users, posts, and comments I created a webpage that lets users view blog posts and if they wanted to comment or create their own posts then they are prompted to login or sign up. I learned how to use handlebars.js and am getting better at using mysql.

## Usage
To use this application you can go to the site to view read blog posts or make posts [here](https://tehcieblog.herokuapp.com/). Make sure to login!

## Contributing
Thank you for investing your time in reading through my code and README. Since I am creating this application for a coding bootcamp I am not taking contributions at this time.
